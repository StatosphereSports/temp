		<p>
       	After many years I have finally found the time to put together a little website for some of the rating models I've played around with. \n

		For now I will start with just my basic AFL Elo Rating model that I have honed over the last couple of years to predict results to some level of accuracy.\n

		I have a number of other models that I play around with when time permits that include significantly more factors as well as a couple of other models that I have put together for other sports so when I get the time I will look to expand and include these as well.
