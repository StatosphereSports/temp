		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
       	After many years I have finally found the time to put together a little website for some of the rating models I've played around with.
       </p>
		<p>
		For now I will start with just my basic AFL Elo Rating model that I have honed over the last couple of years to predict results to some level of accuracy.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have a number of other models that I play around with when time permits that include significantly more factors as well as a couple of other models that I have put together for other sports so when I get the time I will look to expand and include these as well.  
		</p>
		<p>
		All of my models are run through Python and while I feel I am not moderately proficient with it I have no previous experience with HTML so excuse the current design of the site, it is something I hope to work on in the long run as my skills improve in that area.
