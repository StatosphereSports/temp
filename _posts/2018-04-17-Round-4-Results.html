		<h1>Round 4 Results</h1>
		<p>
       	While admittedly my results up to this point are irrelevent given I have only uploaded them after the fact I figured I may as well get a start on post round analysis and what a great round to pick.
       </p>
       <p>
       	What looked to be a fairly onesided round going in proved to be even more so than expected, even if the results didn't always go the way they were predicted.

       <p>
       	Overall it was by far the worst result of the season thus far with a round MAE of 44.89 much higher than the season MAE of 30.88. 
       </p>
       <p>Wet conditions across the round meant that SEARS predicted much higher scoring games in a number of instances than we saw. </p>
